Symbl's APIs empower developers to enable: 
- **Real-time** analysis of free-flowing discussions to automatically surface highly relevant summary discussion topics, contextual insights, suggestive action items, follow-ups, decisions, and questions.\
- **Voice APIs** that makes it easy to add AI-powered conversational intelligence to either [telephony][telephony] or [WebSocket][websocket] interfaces.
- **Conversation APIs** that provide a REST interface for managing and processing your conversation data.
- **Summary UI** with a fully customizable and editable reference experience that indexes a searchable transcript and shows generated actionable insights, topics, timecodes, and speaker information.

## Introduction

This sample implementation shows you how to quickly create a live app using the Symbl Websocket adapter with Agora Web SDK.

### Pre-requisites

* JS ES6+
* Node.js
* npm (or your favorite package manager)
* Agora Account [Agora](https://sso.agora.io/en/v3/signup)

## Setup and Deploy
The first step to getting setup is to [sign up][signup]. 

Update the .env file with the following:
1. SYMBL_APP_ID = your Symbl App ID that you can get from [Platform](https://platform.symbl.ai)
2. SYMBL_APP_SECRET = your Symbl App Secret that you can get from [Platform](https://platform.symbl.ai)
3. REACT_APP_AGORA_APP_ID = App ID for your Agora Project
4. (Optional) If you are implementing a high-security Agora Project you will also need to include an app token.  Low-security Projects only require an App Id.  More on [Agora Authorization](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/token).  Uncomment line 4 in the .env and update REACT_APP_AGORA_TOKEN = your Agora Project token

```
REACT_APP_AGORA_APP_ID=<your-agora-app_id>

# Uncomment line below if using an Agora Project with high security
# REACT_APP_AGORA_TOKEN=<your-agora-token> 

REACT_APP_AGORA_LOG=true
SYMBL_API_BASE_PATH="https://api.symbl.ai"
SYMBL_APP_ID=<symbl-app-id>
SYMBL_APP_SECRET=<symbl-app-secret> 
```

Run the follwing npm commands:
1. `npm install` to download all the node modules
2. `npm start` to start the application
    * Symbl Access Token server is started on port 8081
    * Agora application is started on port 3000
    * Your default browser should open and display the sample application.  If it does not open automatically open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

Enter your Room Name and User Name in the app portal and join the meeting.
    **Note**  If you are using a high-security Agora project, Room Name must match the Agora Channel Name used to generate the token

To test adding multiple meeting participants you can open additional instances of localhost:3000.
